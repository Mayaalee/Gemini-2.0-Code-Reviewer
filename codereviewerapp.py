    Bug/Error Identification
        Identify what language code used
        Clearly explain any errors or bugs found in the provided code.
        Provide a very detailed explanation of all mistakes in the code as well as in terms of coding behavior. Clearly explain each problem.

    Suggested Fixes/Optimizations
        Offer potential fixes for the identified issues.
        Suggest optimizations or corrections, ensure it follows best practices and optimizations.
        Provide a corrected version of the code. 

    Corrected Code
        Provide the corrected version of the code, ensuring that the syntax and logic are valid and functional.
        The corrected code should be fully functional, without errors, and ready to run as code.
        Finally, provide an explanation of changes in the fixed code.
